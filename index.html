            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a quantum scientist working in the field of tensor networks, quantum computing and condensed matter physics. I develop and apply advanced computational methods for practical applications of quantum computers as well as simulating quantum many-body systems. These problems are highly challenging with existing classical methods and/or computers. I am also an experienced programmer in Python, MATLAB, C++, Pascal, etc. I use High Performance Computing to run large scale numerical simulations and GPUs to accelerate their performances.</p>

	    <p>I was a Senior quantum algorithm developer at Pasqal, a neutral atom based quantum computing company. Prior to that, I was an Assistant professor at Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata and Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai. I did my Postdoc in the group of Prof. Jens Eisert at Freie University Berlin and Helmholtz Zentrum, Berlin. I did my PhD with Prof. Roman Orus at University of Mainz, Germany after obtaining my Masters at King's College London, United Kingdom.</p>
